# Game of Life â€“ Mathematica Implementation

This project is an implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** developed using **Wolfram Mathematica**. It simulates a cellular automaton where cells evolve over discrete time steps according to simple rules based on the states of their neighbors. The application is interactive and allows users to experiment with different configurations and observe the system's evolution over time.


The Game of Life is a zero-player game that follows these rules for each cell:
1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation, and all other dead cells stay dead.

These rules are applied simultaneously to all cells at each step to generate the next state.
